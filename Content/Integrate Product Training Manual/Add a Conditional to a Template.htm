        <p class="Body">A conditional is a data condition that, if true, will result in the inclusion of the data from the process template field mappings associated with the screen in the resulting posting script. If the data condition is false, the screen will be left out of the posting script. </p>
        <p class="Body">Each conditional is data record specific. For example, if 10 records are posted, Integrate evaluates the conditional for each record and applies it to the data in the record only. </p>
        <p class="Body">If a conditional is not applied to a screen, the screen will be included in the posting script. </p>
        <p class="Body">Only one conditional can be configured per BDC screen.</p>
        <p class="Note"><span class="span_3">NOTE:</span>Conditionals cannot be modified when a template is active. Conditionals can be applied to custom fields.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="span_3">Create a Condition where Basic Material</span><span class="span_3"> is posted only if it the value is Metal.</span>
